# shoe_shop

# Description
This project provides an opportunity to experiment with the Go programming language by exploring its core features, from basic concepts to advanced techniques. The development is centered around a real-world use case: a shoe shop management system. Through this practical example, the goal is to gain a deep understanding of Go's capabilities and master its essential concepts.
